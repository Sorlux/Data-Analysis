# Data-Analysis and Machine Learning

This repository contains jupyter notebooks and more related to data analysis Projects I have worked on. It is divided into algorithms and then notebooks/project folders populate the algorithm directories. For large projects, a separate repository may be created for the project specifically.

## Structure
- `Big Data`: Work which uses Apache Spark and more.
- `Decision Trees`: Work related to Random Forests, XGBoost, Regression & Classification trees, etc.
- `Deep Learning`: Work related to neural networks such as CNNs. Also includes computer vision projects.
- `Fuzzy Systems`: Work related to Fuzzy systems including Fuzzy Controllers. 
- `Evolutionary Algorithms`: Genetic Algorithms and more
